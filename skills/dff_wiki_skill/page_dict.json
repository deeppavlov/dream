Often, malware is hidden in [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated]] versions of legitimate apps, which are then distributed through third-party app stores. Malware risk also comes from what is known as an \"update attack\", where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component, which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated. As well, one out of three robberies in 2012 in the United States involved the theft of a mobile phone. An online petition has urged smartphone makers to install [[kill switch]]es in their devices. In 2014, Apples \"Find my iPhone\" and Googles \"Android Device Manager\" can locate, disable, and wipe the data from phones that have been lost or stolen. With BlackBerry Protect in OS version 10.3.2, devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even BlackBerrys own Operating System recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account.", "Leaked documents published by [[WikiLeaks]], codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013 to 2016, detail the capabilities of the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and [[cyber warfare]], including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones (including [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]).", "Guidelines for mobile device security were issued by NIST and many other organizations. For conducting a private, in-person meeting, at least one site recommends that the user switch the smartphone off and disconnect the battery."], "Medical": ["With the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place, government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications. These concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice. According to the findings of these medical experts in recent years, excessive smartphone use in society may lead to headaches, sleep disorders and insufficient sleep, while severe smartphone addiction may lead to physical health problems, such as hunchback, muscle relaxation and uneven nutrition."], "Legal": ["A \"patent war\" between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original [[Samsung Galaxy S|Galaxy S]] Android phone copied the interfaceand possibly the hardwareof Apples iOS for the [[iPhone 3GS]]. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving [[Sony Mobile]], [[Google]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]], [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], [[Motorola]], [[HTC]], [[Huawei]] and [[ZTE]], among others. The conflict is part of the [[Technology patent wars|wider \"patent wars\"]] between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase [[market share]], companies granted a [[patent]] can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers. Since the 2010s the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and [[Industrial design right|designs]] in the market for smartphones, and devices based on [[Mobile operating system|smartphone OSes]] such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]], has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, license agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market stated to grow more rapidly by 2012."], "While driving": ["Mobile phone use while driving\u2014including [[Telephone call|call]]ing, [[text messaging]], playing media, [[web browsing]], [[Video game|gaming]], using mapping apps or operating other phone features\u2014is common but controversial, since it is widely considered dangerous due to what is known as [[distracted driving]]. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of [[accident]]s. In September 2010, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones. In March 2011 a US insurance company, [[State Farm Insurance]], announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving. Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free [[telephone call|calling]] on a mobile phone (which uses a [[speakerphone]]) is banned. In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states, only the use of calling on handheld phones is banned, while hands-free use is permitted.", "A 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.", "The [[scientific literature]] on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or [[texting while driving]], is limited. A simulation study at the [[University of Utah]] found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting. Due to the complexity of smartphones that began to grow more after, this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phones incorporated controls for car stereo, [[GPS]] or [[satnav]].", "A 2010 study reviewed the incidence of phone use while [[cycling]] and its effects on behavior and safety. In 2013 a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their phones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four. A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using phones while driving.", "Accidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a [[Telephone call|call]] on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the [[United Kingdom]], from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a handheld phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of [[\u00a3]]60. This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law. [[Japan]] prohibits all use of phones while driving, including use of hands-free devices. New Zealand has banned handheld phone use since 1 November 2009. Many states in the United States have banned text messaging on phones while driving. Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law. As of July 2010, 30 states had banned texting while driving, with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July 15.", "Public Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the [[United States]]. This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992, when first law was passed through December 1, 2010.

A study conducted by the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]s (RPI) Lighting Research Center (LRC) concluded that smartphones, or any backlit devices, can seriously affect [[Stages of sleep|sleep cycles]]. Some persons might become psychologically attached to smartphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices. A \"[[smombie]]\" (a combination of \"smartphone\" and \"[[zombie]]\") is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk, possibly risking an accident in the process, an increasing social phenomenon. The issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a \"mobile lane\" for walking in [[Chongqing]], [[China]]. The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of [[Augsburg, Germany]] to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement."]}, "Lifespan": ["In mobile phones released since the second half of the 2010s, operational life span commonly is limited by built-in batteries which are not designed interchangeable.
