The third-largest empire in history, at its greatest extent stretching over three continents, Europe, Asia, and North America, the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires, leaving the empire lasting 196 years. The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 1812\u20131814 in defeating Napoleons ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south, becoming one of the most powerful European empires of all time."
